# Alba Musica Database
This is an academic project developed in December 2020 for a Database class. The course required a project with a defined complexity, a maximum amount of documentation pages and a fixed number of complex SQL queries.  
This project got 30/30 on it's final review.

This documentation contains:
* Requirements analysis

* ER schemes
* Redundancy analysis
* Queries on the populated DB with results
* Indexes
* C++ program overview

**script.sql** contains the SQL queries to create and populate the database and the 6 required queries (all made with PostgreSQL).  
**alba.cpp** contains the C++ code of a terminal program witch connects to the db and visualizes the queries results.
